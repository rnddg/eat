# Simple Recipe Collection

This is a simple recipe collection of favorites that is meant to be easily accessible from any device, be quick-loading, and easy to contribute to.

Created for both practice and training with git/GitHub and a desire for a simpler way to file our recipes.

### Submitting Recipes

We highly encourage you to submit a recipe! Please try to make sure you're including your own 'perfectly tweaked' version of a recipe, not one cut and pasted verbatim from somewhere on the internet. If you do, please link to the original recipe using the `original_url` variable in each recipe's *YAML front-matter.*

#### What the Heck is YAML Front Matter?

Each recipe is stored in a [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) file, free of HTML code or other clutter.

At the very top of each recipe file, you'll see a block of code that looks like this, as in []:

```

layout: recipe
title: Teriyaki Sauce Two Ways
