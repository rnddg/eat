## Ingredients
- 1 cup Whole Milk, scalded, cooled
- 1 cup Water, room temperature
- 3 tbsp Honey
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin Olive Oil, plus more for greasing bowl
- 2 1/4 tsp instant Yeast (1.8g envelope)
- 1/2 tsp fine Sea Salt
- 4 1/2 cups all-purpose Flour, plus more as needed
- 1 large Egg, beaten

## Process

1. Place milk, water, honey and oil in large mixing bowl. Stir to dissolve honey. Stir in yeast and salt. Gradually stir in flour with large wooden spoon, switching to dough scraper near end, until dough forms.

2. Transfer to floured work surface. Gently knead, adding flour if sticky, until smooth, 5 minutes.

3. Oil bowl large enough for dough to double in size. Place dough in bowl, covering tightly with plastic wrap. Let sit in warm spot until doubled in size, 1 hour.

4. Transfer dough to work surface, briefly kneading to knock out gas. Return to bowl, covering tightly with plastic wrap. Let sit in warm spot for 45 minutes.

5. Transfer dough to floured work surface. Divide into portions the size of a tangerine (this is significantly smaller than a grapefruit). Form each portion into a tight ball. Place 1/2" apart on parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit in warm spot for 30 minutes.

6. Preheat oven to 400ËšF. Bring kettle to boil, pouring 1" layer of water into a roasting pan and place on bottom shelf of oven. _Steam from the water helps the buns rise and form a glossy, brown crust._

7. Brush tops of buns with egg. Bake in upper third of oven until golden brown, 20 minutes.
